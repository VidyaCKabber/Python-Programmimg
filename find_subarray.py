# Given a non-empty array N, of non-negative integers, the degree of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements. Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (# contiguous) subarray of N, that has the same degree as N. For example, in the array [1 2 2 3 1], 
# integer 2 occurs maximum of twice. Hence the degree is 2.
